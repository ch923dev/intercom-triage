# Intercom Triage — Tasks

**Status:** ready · **Version:** 1.5 · **Implements:** `spec.md` v1.5, `plan.md` v1.5

Index of tasks. Each task is a single PR; full bodies (acceptance criteria, dependencies, descriptions) live in [`docs/tasks/`](docs/tasks/).

**Conventions.**
- `[P]` next to a task ID means it may run in parallel with siblings at the same dependency depth.
- `Implements:` (in the detail files) links to FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, US-xxx (from `spec.md`) or plan §x (from `plan.md`).
- `Depends on:` (in the detail files) lists task IDs that must be merged first.
- Acceptance criteria are testable — write the test before the code.

**Status markers.**
- `✓` = shipped and live in `main`.
- `⊘` = superseded. Detail file retains the original body and names the replacement.
- No marker = still open / backlog.

**Changes from v1.4:** added Phase 12 (bulk actions) — T074–T083. Covers Pydantic bulk schemas, six bulk endpoints (resolve / reopen / recategorize / dismiss-chip / followup set / followup clear), backend tests, Vitest harness, `selectionStore` + card/column wiring, `BulkActionBar` + category picker reuse, tickets-store bulk actions with per-id rollback, multi-drag wiring through Board + ResolvedColumn, and `/metrics` counters. Total task count ~83.

**Changes from v1.3:** added Phase 11 (ticket resolution) — T054–T073. Covers Alembic migration, Pydantic schemas, AI prompt/parser, resolver, cache, ingest closure transition, resolution service, endpoints, resolved filter + chip-state, settings, TS types, store, ResolvedColumn, TicketCard + chip, flyout, settings drawer, extension closure pass, popup Resolved tab, docs update, and quality gates. Total task count ~73.

**Changes from v1.2:** added Phase 10 (follow-ups / alarms / notes) — backend T045–T048 + frontend T049–T053. Webapp tokens task T029 expanded to load the design tokens listed in plan §8b. Category seed colors swapped from hex to oklch (T006 already merged — handled as a 1-line patch). Total task count ~55.

**Changes from v1.1:** removed Phase 2 (multi-tenant DB tasks rewritten lighter), Phase 3 (auth — entire phase gone), cloud-deploy tasks collapsed, KMS task removed. Total task count ~40, down from ~59.
